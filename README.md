_[CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) Construct to build Node.js AWS lambdas using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)_

## Usage example

```bash
yarn add aws-lambda-nodejs-webpack
```

```js
// infra/super-app-stack.js
const sns = require("@aws-cdk/aws-sns");
const subscriptions = require("@aws-cdk/aws-sns-subscriptions");
const core = require("@aws-cdk/core");
const { NodejsFunction } = require("aws-lambda-nodejs-webpack");

module.exports = class SuperAppProductionStack extends core.Stack {
  constructor(scope, id, props) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const slackNotificationsLambda = new NodejsFunction(
      this,
      "slack-notifications-lambda",
      {
        entry: "events/slack-notifications.js", // required
      },
    );
  }
};
```

```js
// events/slack-notifications.js
import { WebClient as SlackWebClient } from "@slack/web-api";

export function handler(event) {
  const message = event.Records[0].Sns.Message;
  // do something with message
}
```

## Features

- webpack 5
- fast, [no-docker](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/9120) CDK construct
- lambda output only contains the necessary files, no README, tests, ...
- bundling happens in temporary directories, it never writes in your project directory
- source map support
- TypeScript support
- Babel support (preset-env)
- babel & webpack caching
- node_modules are split into a single `vendor.js` file, minified. Allowing you to debug your own code in AWS console most of the time

## Why?

There's already a dedicated [aws-lambda-nodejs module for CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html) but I had two major issues with it:

1. **CDK uses docker** for anything lambda build related. This means it mounts your whole Node.js project (not just the lambda code) inside Docker before running a bundler like Parcel. This is perfectly fine and performant on Linux and Windows, but this is **extremely slow on macOS**: a single cdk synth would take 2 minutes for a 3 lines lambda. Since it might take a very long time for Docker on macOS to get as fast as on Linux. Even their latest update ([mutagen](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/mutagen/)), while significantly faster, still takes 20s just to mount a Node.js project.
2. aws-lambda-nodejs generates a single file bundle with every local and external module inlined. Which makes it very hard to debug and read on the AWS console. I wanted a lambda output that mimicks my project file organization.

I want to be clear: I respect a LOT the work of the CDK team, and especially [@jogold](https://github.com/jogold/), author of aws-lambda-nodejs) that helped me a lot into debugging performance issues and explaining to me how everything works.

## Roadmap

This is a list of features I thought could be interesting to users. If you need on of them, please contribute to the project.

- [ ] Test/Get feedback on TypeScript support
- [ ] Get feedback on monorepo support
- [ ] Allow passing webpack/babel options/a function that can update the full webpack configuration
- [ ] Allow native modules/passing externals, with option `nativeModules` or `externals`. They would have to be installed into a temp folder with `npm_config_arch` and `npm_config_platform` and aliased in webpack configuration/or considered as externals. Externals and nativeModules seems related options but may be completely different
- [ ] Use [jsii](https://github.com/aws/jsii) to build the construct for other languages
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] (if current way buggy): force people to provide aliases instead of considering cwd as base node_module
- [ ] Allow usage without the need of `entry`: `new NodejsFunction(this, "slack-notifications-lambda");` that would mimic https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html#nodejs-function
- [ ]
- [x] Generate a bundle where entry is moved to /main.js
- [x] Allow using TypeScript
- [x] use webpack and babel cache
- [x] remove webpackconfig from bundle
- [x] pass runtime to babel target
- [x] cdk synth generates different builds even when the lambda code does not changes, issue?
- [x] Allow using babel, if you need preset-env
- [x] add babel preset env by default
- [ ] ~add bundling timing information to output console~ note: this would pollute cdk synth
- [ ] ~Ask CDK team if this could live under their repositories~ Better be just community based
- [ ] Other ideas? Open an issue

## How to make changes and test locally

```
// fork and clone
cd aws-lambda-nodejs-webpack
yarn
yarn link
yarn start

# in another terminal and project where you want to test changes
yarn link aws-lambda-nodejs-webpack
# cdk commands will now use your local aws-lambda-nodejs-webpack
```

## WTF happened to the rollup version?

In case you starred this project early on, it was previously using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) to build lambdas. After hitting roadblocks along the way, for example rollup cannot handle well circular dependencies well, I decided to stop trying to use rollup. Rollup is great to build libraries, but not so great to build web applications. And lambdas are closer to web applications bundling than libraries.

## Thanks

- the CDK team for this awesome project
- [@jogold](https://github.com/jogold/) for his time while helping me debugging performance issues on Docker
